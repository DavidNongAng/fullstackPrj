In the root: 

npm init (Creates package.json file)

npm install express dotenv mongoose colors (Installs all the necessary backend dependencies)

npm instal -D nodemon (Installs nodemon as a dev dependency)

In package.json file, add the following scripts:

"start": "node backend/server.js",
"dev": "nodemon backend/server.js"

that's good for the backend setup.
