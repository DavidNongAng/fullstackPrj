In the root: 

npm init (Creates package.json file)

npm install express dotenv mongoose colors (Installs all the necessary backend dependencies)

npm instal -D nodemon (Installs nodemon as a dev dependency)

In package.json file, add the following scripts:

"start": "node backend/server.js",
"dev": "nodemon backend/server.js"

that's good for the backend setup. 

For the database, inside of the .env file, add the following: 

MONGO_URI = copy and paste the connection string from the MONGOBD Atlas. (make sure to replace password and the collection name)
